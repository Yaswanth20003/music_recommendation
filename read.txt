1. Prepare Your GitHub Repository:
Add gunicorn to requirements.txt:

ini
Copy
Edit
gunicorn==20.1.0
Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt: Example:

ini
Copy
Edit
Flask==3.1.0
gunicorn==20.1.0
pandas==2.2.3
Check Flask entry point:
Ensure your app instance is defined as app in main.py (or your entry file):

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
2. Set Up GitHub for Deployment:
Push your app to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
3. Deploy the Flask App on Render:
Log in to Render with GitHub and authorize access.

Create a New Web Service:

Click New > Web Service.
Choose your GitHub repository.
Fill in the deployment details:

Name: Choose a name (e.g., music_recommendation).
Branch: Select main.
Region: Choose a region (e.g., Oregon).
Set Build and Start Commands:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn main:app (replace main with your file name if needed).
Add Environment Variables (if needed).

Select Instance Type: Choose Free for testing or select a paid option for production.

Click on "Create Web Service" to deploy.

4. Monitor the Deployment:
Render will install dependencies and start your app. Monitor the process in the Logs section.

5. Troubleshoot Common Errors:
Gunicorn Not Found: Ensure gunicorn is in requirements.txt.
Dependency Issues: Ensure all dependencies are listed by running pip freeze > requirements.txt.
App Not Starting: Double-check the Flask app entry point (e.g., main:app).
6. Access Your App:
After deployment, Render will provide a URL for your live app.
